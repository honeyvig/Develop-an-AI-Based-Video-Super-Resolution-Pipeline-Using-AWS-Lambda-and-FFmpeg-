# Develop-an-AI-Based-Video-Super-Resolution-Pipeline-Using-AWS-Lambda-and-FFmpeg
Deep Video Super-Resolution (DVS) solution that operates within AWS Lambda. The goal is to enhance video quality by leveraging cutting-edge AI models (e.g., TecoGAN, EDVR, Real-ESRGAN) while adhering to AWS Lambda’s constraints.

This solution will process videos, improving their resolution by applying AI super-resolution techniques to individual frames or short video segments, ensuring high-quality output with temporal consistency.



Key Deliverables:

1. Preprocessing:
Extract frames from uploaded videos using FFmpeg.
Store frames in AWS Lambda's /tmp directory or S3 buckets.


2. AI Model Integration:

Use state-of-the-art video super-resolution models (e.g., TecoGAN, EDVR, Real-ESRGAN).
Optimize models for efficient inference within AWS Lambda (e.g., converting to ONNX or lightweight frameworks).


3. Post-Processing:

Reassemble enhanced frames into a video using FFmpeg.
Ensure temporal consistency in the output video.


4. AWS Integration:

Download input videos from S3, process them, and upload the enhanced output back to S3.
Handle various video formats efficiently.


5. Performance Optimization:

Ensure the process operates within AWS Lambda’s resource constraints (10 GB memory, 15 minutes runtime, 10 GB storage).
Explore techniques for real-time or near-real-time processing for shorter videos.


6. Testing & Documentation:

Conduct thorough testing on videos of varying resolutions and lengths.
Provide detailed documentation for deploying and maintaining the solution.


The system will also integrate with AWS services for smooth video processing and storage. If you're experienced in deep learning, serverless architecture, and AWS cloud solutions
--------------
To build a Deep Video Super-Resolution (DVS) solution using AWS Lambda that can enhance video quality by leveraging AI models (such as TecoGAN, EDVR, or Real-ESRGAN), we will need to adhere to several steps. The goal is to design a serverless pipeline where videos are uploaded to S3, processed using AI models in Lambda, and then output back to S3.
Steps Overview:

    Preprocessing:
        Extract frames from videos using FFmpeg.
        Store frames in the /tmp directory of Lambda or in S3 buckets.

    AI Model Integration:
        Use video super-resolution models like TecoGAN, EDVR, or Real-ESRGAN.
        Optimize models for inference in Lambda using ONNX or lightweight frameworks.

    Post-Processing:
        Reassemble enhanced frames back into a video using FFmpeg.
        Ensure temporal consistency in the output video.

    AWS Integration:
        Download the video from S3, process it in Lambda, and upload the enhanced video back to S3.

    Performance Optimization:
        Ensure the solution works within AWS Lambda's resource constraints.
        Optimize for short videos to achieve real-time or near-real-time performance.

    Testing & Documentation:
        Test on various video types and document the deployment process.

High-Level Solution Design:

    Input/Output Flow:
        Input video is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
        AWS Lambda is triggered by S3 events (i.e., video upload).
        The Lambda function processes the video, enhancing frames using AI models.
        The enhanced video is then uploaded back to the S3 bucket.

    Lambda Constraints:
        Lambda’s /tmp directory has 512 MB of storage, so video frames will need to be processed in chunks.
        AWS Lambda allows a maximum of 15 minutes of runtime, so we'll need to split large videos into smaller chunks if necessary.

Detailed Python Code Implementation:
1. Install Necessary Packages:

Before starting, ensure the required dependencies are packaged and available in your Lambda function:

    FFmpeg: Used to extract frames and reassemble video.
    ONNX Runtime: To run AI models optimized for inference in Lambda.
    TensorFlow/PyTorch: For using models like TecoGAN, EDVR, or Real-ESRGAN.

You can bundle these dependencies into a deployment package or use a Lambda layer.
2. Lambda Function Code:

import boto3
import ffmpeg
import numpy as np
import onnxruntime as ort
from io import BytesIO
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

    # Prepare input tensor for ONNX model

    # Run inference
    input_name = model_session.get_inputs()[0].name
    output_name = model_session.get_outputs()[0].name
    enhanced_frame = model_session.run([output_name], {input_name: input_tensor})[0]
    
    # Convert enhanced frame back to image format
    enhanced_image = Image.fromarray(enhanced_frame.astype(np.uint8))
    enhanced_frame_path = os.path.join(TMP_DIR, 'enhanced_frame.jpg')

    os.makedirs(frame_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Use FFmpeg to extract frames
    ffmpeg.input(video_path).output(os.path.join(frame_dir, 'frame_%04d.jpg')).run()
    
    return frame_dir

# Function to reassemble frames into a video using FFmpeg
def reassemble_video(frame_dir, output_video_path):
    ffmpeg.input(os.path.join(frame_dir, 'frame_%04d.jpg')).output(output_video_path).run()

# Function to process the video in AWS Lambda
def process_video(event, context):
    # Get video S3 object details from event
    video_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    video_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    
    # Download video from S3
    video_path = os.path.join(TMP_DIR, 'input_video.mp4')
    s3_client.download_file(video_bucket, video_key, video_path)
    
    # Step 1: Extract frames from the video
    frame_dir = extract_frames(video_path)
    
    # Step 2: Load AI model (TecoGAN, Real-ESRGAN, etc.)
    model_path = '/path/to/your/onnx/model.onnx'  # You should bundle this model with the Lambda deployment package
    model_session = load_model(model_path)
    
    # Step 3: Process frames with the AI model
    enhanced_frames = []
    for frame_file in os.listdir(frame_dir):

        enhanced_frame_path = enhance_frame(frame_path, model_session)
        enhanced_frames.append(enhanced_frame_path)
    
    # Step 4: Reassemble enhanced frames into a video
    output_video_path = os.path.join(TMP_DIR, 'output_video.mp4')
    reassemble_video(enhanced_frames, output_video_path)
    
    # Step 5: Upload the enhanced video back to S3
    output_video_key = 'enhanced_' + os.path.basename(video_key)
    s3_client.upload_file(output_video_path, OUTPUT_BUCKET, output_video_key)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f"Video processed and uploaded as {output_video_key}"
    }

# Lambda handler function
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return process_video(event, context)

Key Sections of the Code:

    Model Loading:
        The load_model function loads an ONNX model for inference using onnxruntime.
        You can switch the model to TecoGAN, Real-ESRGAN, or any other super-resolution model by providing the corresponding ONNX model.

    Frame Extraction:
        The extract_frames function uses ffmpeg to extract frames from the uploaded video.

    Frame Enhancement:
        The enhance_frame function processes each frame using the loaded AI model and saves the enhanced frame.

    Reassemble Video:
        The reassemble_video function reassembles the enhanced frames into a new video file using FFmpeg.

    AWS Lambda Integration:
        The Lambda function is triggered by an S3 event when a new video is uploaded.
        The video is downloaded from S3, processed, and the enhanced video is uploaded back to S3.

AWS Lambda Considerations:

    Memory and Time Limit: Ensure the Lambda function doesn't exceed the memory (10 GB) or time (15 minutes) limits. For longer videos, consider splitting them into smaller chunks or using step functions to manage longer workflows.
    Temporary Storage: AWS Lambda provides 512 MB of temporary storage in the /tmp directory. Larger videos may need to be processed in smaller parts and stored temporarily in S3.
    Dependencies: Bundle FFmpeg, ONNX Runtime, and any other dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) in a Lambda layer or deployment package.

Final Steps:

    Deploy the Lambda Function: Deploy this function using AWS Lambda with proper IAM roles to access S3.
    Create S3 Bucket Triggers: Set up S3 event triggers to invoke the Lambda function upon video upload.
    Optimize Performance: For real-time processing, consider using AWS Step Functions to manage long-running video processing workflows.

By following this design, you'll have a fully functional video super-resolution solution running on AWS Lambda, capable of enhancing video quality with cutting-edge AI models and integrated with AWS S3 for efficient storage.
